This rule provides standards for frontend components, ensuring consistent styling and animations:

When working in with React components:

- Always use `@radix-ui` components for low-level visual components
- Order imports based on the following:
    1. External libraries (`react`, `@tanstack/react-router`, `sonner`, etc.)
    2. Assets (`@/assets`)
    3. Services (`@/services`)
    4. Components (`@/components`)
    5. Utils (`@/utils`)

When working with routing:

- Follow `@tanstack/react-router` convensions and best practices
- Keep the routes typesafe
